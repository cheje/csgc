As described, the market cycles from a "euphoria" stage high to a "crisis" stage low. But for investors, each phase whether high or low has the potential for profit or at least anticipated profit. For the tenants living in buildings owned by some investors or investment company, on the other hand, the cycle resembles more of a line of perpetual rent increases and lack of maintenance (Hornbach et al. 2020, 4).'),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The pandemic certainly sparked extraordinary circumstances that left many unable to pay their rent, with debts mounting for both tenants and landlords. But at the root of these tensions is the reality that tenant fears of increasing rent and displacement, service cuts and deferred building maintenance, and changing ownership, stretch back decades (Hornbach et al. 2020, 3). In the past 25 years, tax reform, lending deregulation, cuts in urban funding, and the increasing growth and influence of the financial service industry paved the way for the financialization of housing (Gray 2021; Hornbach et al. 2020, 8; Klein et al. 2020, 20). Investors will scout out locations in which they foresee large-scale changes, such as rezoning and infrastructure development, in anticipation of real estate profits. This approach, known as property speculation, encourages predatory practices that push out long-term tenants (Klein et al. 2020, 19)."),r.a.createElement("p",null,'Speculation involves buying a building at a price higher than its worth \u2013 worth in the sense of generated income not reflecting the purchase price. In these cases, the likely plan of the buyer is to wait it out: They may take out another mortgage for a higher value and once approved, they keep the difference between the original amount they paid for the building, and the increased mortgage. This is known as "pulling out equity." Further, when the building\'s value goes up, the landlord can sell it off and make a profit from the gain between the amount they paid for the building and the new value (Gray 2021; Hornbach et al. 2020, 9).'),r.a.createElement("p",null,'To explain this, the "Corporate Windfalls or Social Housing Conversions?" report gives an example of a landlord that buys a building for $12 million with a mortgage of $10 million. When the property values in the area start to surge over the next few years, the landlord pushes long-term tenants out and takes in new tenants willing to pay higher rents. With a higher income now, the landlord can borrow more money from the bank by taking out a new mortgage of $12 million, thereby pulling in more money \u2013 termed as "pulling out equity." With a new mortgage and more money, the landlord can purchase more properties and build up their portfolio (Hornbach et al. 2020, 12).'),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Given this environment, both the headlines and the real estate cycle obscure the reality that for many renters in New York, much of the ongoing housing crises did not emerge during the pandemic; rather the pandemic exacerbated a situation some 25 years in the making.
