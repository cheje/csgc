                    As above, this chart would also be meant for the eyes of someone looking for trends and individual areas and properties of interest, intended to give them an idea, not comprehensive insight, into ownership among the TCIE dataset. Though it is also visualizing aggregated data, in this case it can lead one in the direction of, say, specific landlords.
