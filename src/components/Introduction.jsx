        ", a report released in November 2020 by the nonprofit{' '}

          Community Service Society of New York

        . As described, the market cycles from a "euphoria" stage high to a 'crisis' stage low, with phases in between.
        But for investors, each stage whether high or low has the potential for profit or anticipated profit. On the
        other hand, for the tenants living in buildings owned by some investors or investment company, the cycle
        resembles more of a line of perpetual rent increases and absence of maintenance work being performed (Hornbach
        et al. 2020, 4).
      </p>
      <p>
        The pandemic certainly sparked extraordinary circumstances that left many unable to pay their rent, with debts
        mounting for both tenants and landlords. But at the root of these circumstances is the reality that tenant
        concerns of increasing rent and displacement, service cuts and deferred building maintenance, and changing
        ownership, stretch back decades (Hornbach et al. 2020, 3). Over the past approximately 25 years, tax reform,
        lending deregulation, cuts in urban funding, and the increasing influence of the financial service industry
        paved the way for the financialization of housing and the consequent rise of rental building values (Gray 2021;
        Hornbach et al. 2020, 8; Klein et al. 2020, 20). Investors will scout out locations in which they foresee
        large-scale changes, such as rezoning and infrastructure development, in anticipation of making money off of
        real estate. This approach, known as property speculation, encourages predatory practices that push out
        long-term tenants (Klein et al. 2020, 19).
      </p>
      <p>
        Speculation involves buying a building at a price higher than its worth – worth in the sense of generated income
        not reflecting the purchase price. In these cases, the likely intention of the buyer is to wait it out: They may
        refinance their mortgage, meaning they replace their current one with a new mortgage at possibly a higher value,
        and once approved, they keep the difference between the original amount they paid for the building, and the
        increased mortgage. This is known as "pulling out equity." Further, when the building's value goes up, the
        landlord can sell it off and make a profit from the gain between what they paid for the building and the new
        value (Gray 2021; Hornbach et al. 2020, 9).
      </p>
      <p>
        To explain this, the "Corporate Windfalls or Social Housing Conversions?" report gives an example of a landlord
        who buys a building for $12 million with a mortgage of $10 million. When the property values in the area start
        to surge over the following years, the landlord pushes out long-term tenants and takes in new people willing to
        pay higher rents. Now with an increased income, the landlord can borrow more money from the bank by taking out a
        new mortgage of $12 million, thereby pulling in more money – termed as "pulling out equity." With a new mortgage
        and more money, the landlord can purchase more properties and build up their portfolio (Hornbach et al. 2020,
        12).

        Given this environment, both the headlines and the real estate cycle obscure the reality that for many renters
        in New York, much of the ongoing housing crises did not emerge during the pandemic; rather the pandemic
        exacerbated a situation decades in the making. Between 1995 and 2007, the average annual sales price for a
        rental building in the city went up nearly 400 percent in all but Staten Island, according to data from{' '}

        </a>
        , a city data hub from the NYU Forman Center. The values dipped during the 2008 crisis but even then, in
        accordance with the real estate cycle, investors spent this brief period of decrease by purchasing buildings at
        lower prices in anticipation of profiting when the market recovered soon after (Hornbach et al. 2020, 8). While
        recovery may come relatively quickly for high earning investors after such dips, for many tenants, particularly
        in communities of color and largely immigrant areas, recovery will be at best a relative concept.

        For my capstone project, I will explore a dataset of landlord incomes and expenses, from the perspective of an
        analyst – whether that be a journalist, researcher, or housing advocate – and use visualizations to navigate
        through the data points, as well as to spark questions and possible answers, and to try to pinpoint buildings
        exhibiting indicators of speculation. Beyond the scope of this project, the aim would be to locate buildings or
        areas of potential interest in a quest to find personal stories of residents and families impacted by a
        precarious living environment, whether that be amid a pandemic or in otherwise typical times.
