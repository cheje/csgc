        of the COVID-19 pandemic on city real estate. Rich neighborhoods '

          Corporate Windfalls or Social Housing Conversions?
        </a>
        ' released by the nonprofit Community Service Society of New York in November 2020. As described, the market
        cycles from a 'euphoria' stage high to a 'crisis' stage low. But for investors, each phase whether high or low
        has the potential for profit or at least anticipated profit. For the tenants living in buildings owned by some
        investors or investment company, on the other hand, the cycle resembles more of a line of perpetual rent
        increases and lack of maintenance (Hornbach et al. 2020, 4).
      </p>
      <p>
        The pandemic certainly sparked extraordinary circumstances that left many unable to pay their rent, with debts
        mounting for both tenants and landlords. But at the root of these tensions is the reality that tenant fears of
        increasing rent and displacement, service cuts and deferred building maintenance, and changing ownership,
        stretch back decades (Hornbach et al. 2020, 3). In the past 25 years, tax reform, lending deregulation, cuts in
        urban funding, and the increasing growth and influence of the financial service industry paved the way for the
        financialization of housing (Gray 2021; Hornbach et al. 2020, 8; Klein et al. 2020, 20). Investors will scout
        out locations in which they foresee large-scale changes, such as rezoning and infrastructure development, in
        anticipation of real estate profits. This approach, known as property speculation, encourages predatory
        practices that push out long-term tenants (Klein et al. 2020, 19).
      </p>
      <p>
        Speculation involves buying a building at a price higher than its worth – worth in the sense of generated income
        not reflecting the purchase price. In these cases, the likely plan of the buyer is to wait it out: They may take
        out another mortgage for a higher value and once approved, they keep the difference between the original amount
        they paid for the building, and the increased mortgage. This is known as 'pulling out equity.' Further, when the
        building's value goes up, the landlord can sell it off and make a profit from the gain between the amount they
        paid for the building and the new value (Gray 2021; Hornbach et al. 2020, 9).
      </p>
      <p>
        To explain this, the 'Corporate Windfalls or Social Housing Conversions?' report gives an example of a landlord
        that buys a building for $12 million with a mortgage of $10 million. When the property values in the area start
        to surge over the next few years, the landlord pushes long-term tenants out and takes in new tenants willing to
        pay higher rents. With a higher income now, the landlord can borrow more money from the bank by taking out a new
        mortgage of $12 million, thereby pulling in more money – termed as 'pulling out equity.' With a new mortgage and
        more money, the landlord can purchase more properties and build up their portfolio (Hornbach et al. 2020, 12).
      </p>

        Given this environment, both the headlines and the real estate cycle obscure the reality that for many renters
        in New York, much of the ongoing housing crises did not emerge during the pandemic; rather the pandemic
        exacerbated a situation some 25 years in the making. For my capstone project, with these considerations as the
        backdrop, I will explore a dataset of landlord incomes and expenses from the perspective of an analyst – whether
        that be a journalist, researcher or advocate – and use visualizations to navigate through the observations and
        try to pinpoint buildings exhibiting indicators of speculation. Beyond the scope of this project, the aim would
        ultimately be to locate buildings or areas of potential interest in a quest to find personal stories of tenants
        impacted by the aforementioned, in a city of persistent precarity.
